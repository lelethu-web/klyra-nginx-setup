The Klyra Nginx Setup project demonstrates a DevOps workflow for deploying a simple web application in a cloud environment. Its main goals are:

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

Use Terraform to provision an AWS EC2 instance and a security group automatically.

**Cloud Deployment**

Launch a fully functional EC2 instance on AWS and configure network access via a security group.

**Containerized Web Server**

Deploy Nginx as a Docker container on the EC2 instance to serve a basic web page.

**Version Control and Automation**

Use Git to track changes in infrastructure and configuration.

Ensure reproducibility and traceability of all changes.
